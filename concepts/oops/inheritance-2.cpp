/*
Our example models a database of employees of a widget company. Weâ€™ve simplified the situation
so that only three kinds of employees are represented. Managers manage, scientists perform
research to develop better widgets, and laborers operate the dangerous widget-stamping presses.
- The database stores a name and an employee identification number for all employees, no matter
what their category.
- for managers, it also stores their titles and golf club dues.
- For scientists, it stores the number of scholarly articles they have published.
- Laborers need no additional data beyond their names and numbers.
